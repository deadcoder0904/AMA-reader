# AMA-reader

Note :-
This is a project made to learn just HTML5, CSS3 & JS without any frameworks.

:warning: THIS WAS A MISTAKE. BUT I'M THANKFUL TO MAKE THIS MISTAKE. WITH THIS PROJECT, I LEARNED WHY WE NEED FRAMEWORK BCZ THIS WHAT I MADE IS A SINGLE PAGE APP. AND IT HAS A LOT OF `DIPSLAY:NONE` & `DIPSLAY:BLOCK` GOING ON IN THE BACK. ALSO, THE PAGE LOAD IS VERY SLOW. IMHO, THE USER INTERFACE IS A LITTLE NICE WITH THE USER EXPERIENCE. BUT, OTHER THAN THAT NEVER USE PLAIN JAVASCRIPT FOR ANYTHING THAT REQUIRES MAINTAINING THE STATE. ALWAYS, GO WITH REACT, ANGULAR, VUE, SVELTE, INFERNO, ETC....
